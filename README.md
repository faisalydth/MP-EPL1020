# MP-EPL1020

## Introduction

Here is the implementation of Python Programming and Data Story Telling about EPL Teams Goals Scored Since 2010/2011.

I get the data in JSON format from [here](https://github.com/openfootball/football.json) and process it in JupyterLab with python language.
Then, I created the interactive bar chart with Flourish for data visualization. [Check this out](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7923190/) for more details of the output.

## About Repository

**Data Story Telling**

It's not just a number. It tell us about the journey of EPL teams scoring goals for their fans. Since 2010/2011 until 2019/2020, 36 teams have participated in the league.

They are fighting for the title, also surviving not to be degraded. The top 7 teams that have stayed in the league for a decade since 2010 are: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, and Tottenham Hotspur.

Those teams scored a lot of goals, it visible trough the chart. For the first season until 2013/2014 on Matchday 27, Man United leads the goals scoring accumulation by 296 goals, followed by Man City and Arsenal with 292 and 270 goals respectively.

But after that match, Man City went crazy. The Citizen, another name for Man City, finish up many teams with many goals scored. Till the end of season 2019/2020, the team is irreplaceable in 1st place as top scorer accumulated since 2010 by 858 goals, have a difference of more than 100 goals with the 2nd placed team, Liverpool. By stats, at least 2 goals have been scored in each match by the team over the span of a decade.

But the other interesting is, Liverpool did an incredible accelaration. Since we know that JÃ¼rgen Klopp came on to replace Brendan Rodgers at the beginning season of 2015/2016 as manager, slowly they crawl to the top from 5th position. Proven by stats, they scored 398 goals in just 4 seasons. 2nd place deserves to them at the end. It's incredible, right?

By the way, unexpectedly Man United fell into 5th, from 1st place we knew at the beginning. What happened with the team? More data can be tell us more. However, I am a fan. So which one is your favourite EPL team? Please comment below!
